# AIM :Write a python script to read two integer numbers and perform arithmetic operations.

# SOURCE CODE :

a=int(input("enter the value of a"))
b=int(input("enter the value of b"))
print("addition is:",a+b)
print("subtraction is:",a-b)
print("multiplication is:",a*b)
print("division is:",a/b)
print("modulus is:",a%b)
print("floor division is:",a//b)
print("expponentiation is:",a**b)

""" INPUT :
       enter the value of a 4
       enter the value of b 2
       
OUTPUT:
      addition is: 6

      multiplication is: 8
      division is: 2.0
      modulus is: 0
      floor division is: 2
      expponentiation is: 16
